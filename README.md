# groups
Discuss applications of group theory in crystal structures, rubik's cubes and sudoku puzzles.
This is gonna be a fun exploration .
We are going to start with a list of natural questions to ask about these subjects and hopefully by the end of our exploration we will have found and understood answers to most of them.
Remember to have fun :)
